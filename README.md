# Dungeon Game
__Metaswitch C++ Coding Exercise__

dungeon_game.cpp is the original game, without enemies. This should be fine.

cooler_game.cpp is the new game with enemies. More difficult! Enemies can move diagonally, but their extra power comes at a price - they can move off the boundary too. Monsters can even move 2 spaces, for some reason.
