# dungeon_game
<b>Metaswitch C++ Coding Exercise</b>

dungeon_game.cpp is the original game, without enemies. This should be fine.

cooler_game.cpp is the new game with enemies. Not so stable at the moment! Enemies can move diagonally, but their extra power comes at a price - they can move off the boundary too. Monsters can even move 2 spaces, for some reason.
